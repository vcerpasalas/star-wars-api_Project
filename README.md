# Star Wars API Project

This is a simple web application that retrieves data from the Star Wars API and displays it on a web page. The application displays two sections, "People" and "Films", and uses JavaScript to fetch data from the API and create HTML elements to display the data.

## Getting Started

To get started with this application, you can simply clone the repository and open the `index.html` file in your web browser. The web page will be displayed with the data fetched from the Star Wars API.

## Technologies Used

This web application was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The data is retrieved from the Star Wars API using the `fetch` function in JavaScript.

## Features

This application has two main features:

- Displaying a list of people from the Star Wars universe, including their name, height, mass, and birth year.
- Displaying a list of films from the Star Wars universe, including their title.

## Future Improvements

In the future, the following improvements can be made to the application:

- Adding more sections to display data from other categories, such as planets or species.
- Improving the styling of the web page to make it more visually appealing.
- Adding more interactivity to the web page, such as allowing users to filter or sort the data displayed.

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute to this project, feel free to open a pull request. However, please note that this is a simple project meant to demonstrate fetching and displaying data from an API, so major changes may not be accepted.
